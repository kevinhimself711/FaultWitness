# FaultWitness Repository Instructions

## Mission and current phase

FaultWitness is a multi-tenant Agent Runtime for investigating microservice incidents, proposing bounded remediations, executing approved actions, and producing auditable evaluation and training assets.

G00 is closed and G01 is in progress. I-0007 and EVAL-G01-001 are complete. I-0008/I-0009 implementation is landed with EVAL-G01-002/003 candidate debt retained. I-0010 passed its Windows deterministic conformance/mutation run on `f81c7f0`; cross-platform digest evidence remains due before Gate closure. I-0011 is the sole active Iteration and authorizes only owner-isolated PostgreSQL state, migrations, idempotency, Outbox/Inbox/DLQ, Redis Streams delivery, fenced encrypted checkpoints, and crash recovery. It does not authorize APIs, Agent graph behavior, external actions, or exactly-once claims.

## Source-of-truth order

When artifacts disagree, use this precedence and stop to resolve the drift instead of silently choosing one:

1. The authoritative final project plan.
2. The active Gate plan and accepted ADRs.
3. Versioned public contracts and machine-readable state-machine specifications.
4. Tests and implementation.
5. Generated reports and explanatory documentation.

PROJECT_STATE.yaml is the authority for the active Gate and iteration, not for architecture semantics.

## Required workflow

- No behavioral change may begin without an iteration plan.
- A Gate Master Plan must be frozen before its implementation iterations start.
- Behavioral changes, affected tests, documentation, and version manifests belong in the same commit.
- Do not lower a Gate threshold, modify locked tests, or alter ground truth in an implementation commit.
- Failed Gates, negative experiments, and rejected architectures must remain in the repository history.
- Gate closure is a separate asset-only commit evaluated against an immutable candidate SHA.
- Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly requests it.

Planning-only commits may create or refine future Iteration and Eval assets without activating them. They never authorize product behavior, infrastructure mutation, credential use, or live evaluation.

## Architecture invariants

- Incident, Runtime Task, Agent Graph, and ActionTransaction are separate state machines with separate owners.
- Components communicate across ownership boundaries through typed commands and transactional outbox events.
- Tenant identity comes from authenticated context and cannot be supplied or overridden by request bodies.
- The Agent can propose ToolCall and ActionProposal objects but cannot execute arbitrary shell commands or write directly to Kubernetes.
- Action Executor is the only write boundary and must enforce policy, approval, idempotency, postconditions, and compensation.
- R2 actions cannot execute without a valid immutable approval digest.
- At-least-once task delivery must be paired with idempotent external actions; never claim distributed exactly-once execution.
- UNCERTAIN action outcomes cannot be retried blindly.
- Ground truth and locked evaluation data are never accessible to the Agent runtime.
- Do not store or expose private model chain of thought. Store structured summaries, evidence references, tool events, and state deltas only.

Changes to these invariants require an ADR, an architecture version update, migration and replay analysis, and targeted regression tests before implementation.

## Evidence and documentation rules

- Raw job descriptions, interview notes, restricted documents, secrets, and private traces must not be committed.
- Public requirements may contain source IDs and paraphrases, not copied source bodies.
- Tier-C coaching answers cannot be the sole evidence for a mandatory requirement or metric.
- Every public claim must eventually map to code, tests, trace or dataset evidence, and a reproducible evaluation.
- Code, APIs, schemas, identifiers, and code comments are English.
- AGENTS.md is English. Design, evaluation, and retrospective documents are primarily Chinese with English technical identifiers.

## Commands

The governance CLI is established. The canonical entry point is:

    uv run python -m faultwitness_dev <command>

Makefile targets may wrap the canonical command on Linux but must not become the source of truth.

## Safety

- Never commit credentials or decrypted secret files.
- Never run privileged server, chaos, sandbox, or remediation commands unless the active iteration explicitly authorizes the exact environment and test.
- Public CI must never receive privileged server, Kubernetes administrator, model-provider, or production-like secrets.
- Never overwrite an existing remote repository or reuse an unexpected directory when bootstrapping.
